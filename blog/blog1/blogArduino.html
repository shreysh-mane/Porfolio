              So basically you can call arduino a easy to use micro-contrller
              which enbles you to communicate with your electronic sensors. It
              is very user frinedly hardware working with a 5v dc supply and can
              provide 5v and 3.3v on board potential.
            </p>
            <p>
              The main thing which differentiate arduino from other boards is
              that the arduino is very easy to use and its compatibility with
              other electronic sensors. It provides a lot of libreries for every
              sensor and by using those libreries you can code your sensor
              easily without deep understading of that sensor.

              The arduino board have a USB port and a dc power jacket to power
              itself. The usb port is also used to porgramme the arduino board.
              The dc power jack have a voltage regulator with rating of 20v. So
              never give a voltage more than 20v to your arduino board otherwise
              it will burn the circuit present inside the arduino.

              There are total 28 pins in arduino. In that 14 are of digital
              pins, 6 analog pins,1 5v pin,1 Vin pin, 3 ground pins, 1 Reset
              pin,1 Analog Reference pin, and 1 3.3v pin.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span id="symbol">&#9899; </span> Analog Pins: These pins are used
              to take analog input ranging form 0v to 5v. It will give reading a
              0 if the input provided on the pin is of 0v and it will show
              reading as 1023 if the input voltage provided on the pin is 5v.

              <span id="symbol">&#9899; </span> Digital Pins: These pins are
              used to calculate digital inputs. The input of digital pin will
              show 0 when we provide 0v to the pin and it will show 1 as reading
              when we apply 5v on the pin.

              <span id="symbol">&#9899; </span> PWM pin: You can see "~" this
              symbol on some pins. This symbol denotes that these pins can be
              used to output analog voltage ranging from 0v to 5v. Other pins
              which do not have "~" this symbol can only give ouput in digital
              value either 0v or 5v. To give varing analog voltage as output you
              can give command to the pwm pins. where 0 represent 0v and 1023
              represent 5v and the values in between them represent voltages in
              between 0v and 5v.

              <span id="symbol">&#9899; </span> vin pin: The vin pin can be used
              to power the arduino. You have to provide 5v to it so the arduino

              To programme the arduino board we require ardunio IDE. Inside the
              IDE we can get many options like to write a code, debug/verify
              your code, upload your code, The IDE also contains a serial
              monitor so you can see the inputs we got from the arduino board.
              The the arduino IDE is cross plarform and it is available for
              every operation system. ".ino" extension is used to save the
              arduino IDE file. The arduino IDE mainly support C and C++
              language.

              <span id="symbol">&#9899; </span> Upload : The upload button is
              used to upload the code in arduinio. The ide first convert the
              human readable code into hex form and the hex code is then
              uploaded on the arduino IC.
